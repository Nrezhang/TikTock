![Code of Conduct](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code_of_Conduct-green)

## Our Pledge
Tiktock is an extension that is meant to allow users to have an easier time doing their work with a fun extension. This code of conduct guides the way that we act and make decisions. TikTock welcomes everyone and anyone and pushes to create a safe and welcoming environment, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, ethnicity, race, nationality, age, religion, and other personal elements.

### Three Top Core Values of Tiktock: 
1. Respect, Welcome, Think
- Collaborate and discuss respectfully. Think before you write, discuss, and publish!
2. Collaborate
- Collaboration is what allows open source projects to thrive. Thus, we value collaboration. Input your ideas and be creative. 
> **_NOTE:_** Your ideas should be respectful to everyone in the community and beyond. 
3. Responsible
- Take accountability to your actions. Your actions matter and have the opportunity to affect those around you. 

## Our Standards
Creating a positive and welcoming environment is a key element in creating a successful open source project. 
Some examples that create a positive and welcoming environment are: 
- Respect all types of experiences and learnings
- Think about how and what can make this project have a better impact for everyone working and using it
- Be empathetic with others 

Not all conflicts are bad; some conflicts can help bring experiences and points of view that were not thought about before. However, conflicts that become disrespectful are unacceptable. Some examples include: 
- Publically and/or privately harassing
- Insulting, trolling, etc. 
- Using sexualized lanaguage, imagery, etc. 

### Where does this Code of Conduct Apply? 
Everywhere! Here, there, and everywhere, that has to do with representing the project and the community. Representing the project can mean being a contributor, a user, or simply spreading the word about the project.

### Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html), version 1.4.

## Summary 
- Treat people with respect.
- Collaborate with others.
